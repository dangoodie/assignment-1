    <h3>Interest In IT</h3>
    <p>
      I have been interested in tech since I was young. I initially got into my
      current career as a lighting director because I loved tech so much. A job
      that let you play around with lights was right up my alley. Through COVID
      I decided that I wanted to study IT part time so that I could broaden my
      skills and potentially even make a career jump from my industry into tech.
      I chose to come to RMIT because I did some courses here and I loved the
      instructors and the system of how they teach. It is very easily laid out
      and I liked that a lot. I had done some other tech courses and the quality
      of the teaching here was much better. I expect to learn a lot of skills including programming, working with databases, and development. My ideal job is web development and I am hoping that this will give me a good foundation to look for work out in the industry.
